# libft
Usual very practical functions. through this project, we suggest you take the time to rewrite these functions, understand them and make them yours. 
You can then reuse your library to work efficiently on your following C projects.
This project is also an opportunity for you to extend the list of requested functions with yours and thus make your library even more useful.
Feel free to top up your libft gradually when needed.
